                    In Persona 5, you'll play as the protagonist. He has moved to Tokyo from his hometown after 
                    being accused and charged with assault, a crime which he didn't commit. He has one job: live
                    an honest and normal life until his 1 year probation period is over. However, this will prove
                    to be much more difficult then he may have thought...

                    Shortly after coming to Tokyo, you accidentaly enter the Metaverse, a world where people's
                    deepest and most warped desires take form. Here, the protagonist awakens to his Persona, a
                    manifestation of someone's inner rebellion. With this newfound power, you decide to form a
                    group, known as the Phantom Theives, to reform society and make all the rotton criminals confess
                    their crimes!

                    In Persona 5, you and the rest of the Phantom Theives traverse through "Palaces", spaces
                    in the Metaverse that are ruled by a single Palace owner. Inside these Palaces, Shadows
                    roam and will attack you and your group. It's up to you guys to strike back and defeat
                    these monsters, while also maintaining the style and class that the Phantom Theives are
                    known for!

                    Instead of defeating Shadows, try negotiating with them instead! When you've downed
                    all the enemies, you'll enter a "Hold Up!", where you can choose to talk to the 
                    enemy and ask them for money and items in exchange for letting them go free. Play
                    your cards right, and you may even be able to recruit them to your team as a Persona!
